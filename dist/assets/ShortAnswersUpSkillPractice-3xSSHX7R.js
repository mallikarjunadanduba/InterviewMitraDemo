The outcome was successful delivery 2 days ahead of schedule with 95% client satisfaction.",wordLimit:150},{shortAnswerId:2,question:"How do you prioritize tasks when you have multiple deadlines approaching simultaneously?",expectedAnswer:"I use the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize tasks by urgency and importance. Critical and urgent tasks get immediate attention, important but not urgent tasks are scheduled, urgent but not important tasks are delegated when possible, and neither urgent nor important tasks are eliminated. I also communicate with stakeholders to negotiate realistic deadlines when necessary.",wordLimit:100},{shortAnswerId:3,question:"Explain a time when you had to adapt to a significant change in your work environment.

How did you manage the relationship?",expectedAnswer:"I worked with a team member who was consistently negative and resistant to change. I managed this by: 1) Understanding their perspective and concerns through private conversations, 2) Finding common ground and shared goals, 3) Providing clear expectations and regular feedback, 4) Involving them in decision-making processes to increase buy-in, 5) Focusing on their strengths and contributions.
